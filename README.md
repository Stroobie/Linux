# Stroobie's Mac Linux Scripts

Welcome to **Stroobie's Mac Linux Scripts**! This repository contains a collection of scripts Stroobie has put together to simplify life while using Linux on Mac. While Stroobie primarily works in Debian-based environments, you'll also find scripts for Arch and RHEL when required.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**
These scripts come **as is**. If you're not sure what a script is doing, it might be best not to run it. While Stroobie can promise the scripts are safe, using Linux effectively means practicing good security measures. If no one asks you to be careful, you won‚Äôt learn anything!

> **Remember:** Your security is your responsibility. Always review scripts and understand their impact on your system.

## üõ†Ô∏è **What's Inside?**
- Scripts for **Debian-based distributions**.
- Occasional support for **Arch** and **RHEL**.
- **Tools** to make everyday tasks on Mac Linux easier.

## **Running the Scripts**
You'll run them like any other scripts, just remember!
```
chmod +x scriptname.sh 
```
and 
```
sudo ./scriptname.sh
```
## **The script isn't woring right?**
Sometimes, installing dos2unix fixes this issue with scripts. At least, it does for me. 
```
sudo apt install dos2unix -y
```
## **üîÑ Contributions**
I don't really take them, but I will not really turn them away? Firm believer in FOSS? Yeah!

## **‚ùì Support**
I do not offer much but will answer questions when I can. Please remember that Linux isn't for everyone, but I applaud you for making the jump. 

## **Why would you do this?**
A lot of the vintage / older Mac stuff is still great even after Apple ends OS support for them. My currently daily driver is a Macbookpro 2015 15 Inch and it runs great on Linux!
