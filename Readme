**Stroobie's Linux Scripts
Welcome to Stroobie's Linux Scripts! This repository contains a collection of scripts Stroobie has put together to simplify life while using Linux. While Stroobie primarily works in Debian-based environments, you'll also find scripts for Arch and RHEL when required.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These scripts come as is. If you're not sure what a script is doing, it might be best not to run it. While Stroobie can promise the scripts are safe, using Linux effectively means practicing good security measures. If no one asks you to be careful, you won‚Äôt learn anything!

**Remember: Your security is your responsibility. Always review scripts and understand their impact on your system.
